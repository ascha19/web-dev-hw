    <h1>Avery Schakosky</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage! Actually, it's only my first webpage in this class. I took Creative Coding 1 during my first semester of college, so I learned a lot of this stuff already, like how to make a repo and most of the content inside it, and how to use GitHub. This account is actually the one I used for that class, and the stuff I made during that class is still on it! Still on it and still functioning are two different things; I had quite a few issues with certain things during that class, and ended up with three repos. To this day, not sure which one is the functioning one, if any of them function as all.</p>
