1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

The universal selector type is used to select every element on the page and is useful if you want to style something for the entire page, such as a change in font. Element selectors select every element of specified type, such as a header, and is useful when wanting to create a style across a specific element. Classes select elements that have the same function and helps to better organize elements. Finally, ids further organize elements by giving them unique IDs; they're helpful when creating styles for specific elements alone.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I tried to get the colors of my palette as close to the colors of the pattern that inspired my page as possible. The colors I came up with were:

- white
- #33cccc
- #a300cc
- #1e1e7b


3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I first set all the files up with the usual formatting and read the class information. As soon as I saw the idea suggesting a decade and the blurb about making this page as ugly/tacky as I wanted, I knew exactly what I wanted to do: a 90s-themed page about a really popular "90s nostalgia" cup pattern, which I now know is called the Solo Jazz pattern. I did far too much research on it just to write the little blurbs about it that I did.

The first styling I did was making the background of the page the pattern itself. Then I played around with the colors and fonts; I really wanted to make the page tacky, so I used the most hated and memed font, Comic Sans. Then I worked on designing my divs and sections. I wanted to alternate between divs and sections, but I had problems with the formatting and the multiple sections kept overlapping, so I settled for one div, one section, and different headers. I wrote a little history blurb about the Solo Jazz pattern, and included images and gifs involving the pattern throughout the page and I went on adding text. Since the pattern itself is a meme and I ended up making my page kind of meme-y (and because I wanted more content on the page but also I'm half-asleep finishing this assignment), I decided to add some other silly content, such as "reviews" of the design which were created with the help of a friend. I also wanted to end the page with a weird closing statement, just to pull it all together, but I thought it would be kind of funny to add a whole list of them. The only part of this assignment I wasn't sure what to do about was messing with something's opacity, so I decided to add a final bit of online humor content with a small picture at the end of the page of Danny Devito Photoshopped on a Dorito. Danny Dorito.
