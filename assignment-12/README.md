1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

Last week I created a fake company to base my mock site around, and when I saw that the next assignment was an actual site, I decided to just build off the one I already started. So, my client is the owner of a cafe and spa that specializes in cocoa-based products, called Cocoa Bean & Butter. The fake client's fake demands revolve around a warm theme involving tans and browns that will match their logo. They want a main page that frames one of their most popular cocoa beverages and provides a noticeable link to the online shop of their products. Alongside that, they want other pages that match the main page's aesthetic, providing contact info, booking and event info, and info about the company. Because they have such an interest in cocoa and cocoa products, they want to include info of the history of some of their main products; they also like to promote other businesses similar to theirs, and want a link that can be updated with a link to another business similar to theirs.
