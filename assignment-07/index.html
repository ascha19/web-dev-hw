      <h1>Lyrics</h1>
      <h2>"Dani California"</h2>
      <h3>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h3>
      <p>
      Getting born in the state of Mississippi<br />
      Papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy<br />
      In Alabama she would swing a hammer<br />
      Price you got to pay when you break the panorama<br />
      She never knew that there was anything more than poor<br />
      What in the world does your company take me for?<br />
      Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana<br />
      Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana<br />
      She's a runner<br />
      Rebel, and a stunner<br />
      On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?<br />
      Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five<br />
      Just another way to survive<br />
      California, rest in peace<br />
      Simultaneous release<br />
      California, show your teeth<br />
      She's my priestess<br />
      I'm your priest<br />
      Yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      She's a lover, baby, and a fighter<br />
      Should've seen it coming when I got a little brighter<br />
      With a name like Dani California<br />
      Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya<br />
      A little loaded, she was stealing another breath<br />
      I love my baby to death<br />
      California, rest in peace<br />
      Simultaneous release<br />
      California, show your teeth<br />
      She's my priestess<br />
      I'm your priest<br />
      Yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      Who knew the other side of you?<br />
      Who knew that others died to prove?<br />
      Too true to say goodbye to you<br />
      Too true to say, say, say<br />
      Pushed the fader, gifted animator<br />
      One for the now, and eleven for the later<br />
      Never made it up to Minnesota<br />
      North Dakota man<br />
      Wasn't gunnin' for the quota<br />
      Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last<br />
      It only hurts when I laugh<br />
      Gone too fast<br />
      California, rest in peace<br />
      Simultaneous release<br />
      California, show your teeth<br />
      She's my priestess<br />
      I'm your priest<br />
      Yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
      California, rest in peace<br />
      Simultaneous release<br />
      California, show your teeth<br />
      She's my priestess<br />
      I'm your priest<br />
      Yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
