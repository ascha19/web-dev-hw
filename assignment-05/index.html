  <h2> Lemon Madeleines </h2>

<hr />

  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p>
      1. 3/4 cup (180 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour<br />
      2. 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) baking powder <br />
      3. 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) salt <br />
      4. 2 eggs <br />
      5. 1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar <br />
      6. Grated zest of 1 lemon<br />
      7. 1/2 cup (125 ml) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temparature
    </p>

  <h3> Directions </h3>
    <p>
      1. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.<br />
      2. In another bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and lemon zest with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes or until the mixture forms a ribbon when the beater is lifted.<br />
      3. With a whisk, gently fold in the dry ingredients. Fold the butter in the same way. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.<br />
      4. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 200 °C (400 °F). Butter and flour a small madeleine pan. Set aside.<br />
      5. Fill each cavity three-quarter up with batter. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the madelienes are lightly golden brown. Remove from the pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining of the batter. If desired, serve with lemon curd.<br />
      <strong>Note:</strong> This batter will keep for three to four days in the refrigerator. Madeleines are best baked the same day they will be eaten. The baking time for standard-sized madeleines is about 14 minutes.
