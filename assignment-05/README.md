1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

The <head> of a page can hold many a number of META elements. These elements contain information that isn't visible to the public but helps display the page better. Some roles these elements play include creating a description that will be displayed when search engines display the page, defining the author of the webpage, adding style elements to the page (background color, font color, etc.), controlling the page's dimensions, and more.

The <body> of the page, unlike the <head>, is visible to the public and the elements used in the <body> are visible as well. Some of these elements include citations and definitions, and font styles, such as <strong>/bolding and <emphasis>/italicizing. These elements help to better organize and define what viewers see.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup embeds information about the page's structure, such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup reinforces the meanings of information on a page, such as giving words meaning with <emphasis> or <bold>, or providing definitions and citations.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Firstly, I created the main folder and README for this assignment, and then the index file.

After that, I added all the necessary meta data for the <head> portion of my index.html page, as well as set up the headings for the <body> section to prepare to provide my recipe. From there, I added the ingredients, then instructions. At first, I'd just added these like I normally would have, but then edited them to fit with the guidelines of the assignment. I pretty much did the same for the rest of the page; I added the basic information first, then adjusted the formatting as needed.
