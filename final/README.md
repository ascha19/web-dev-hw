Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

A lot of the stuff we learned about regarding web development I had some idea about already. However, this class focused a lot more on HTML than the other class I took did, so I learned quite a bit more about HTML than I had known previously.

Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

I learned a lot of new stuff about web design, both from the class itself and from stuff I looked up on my own. Most of what I knew previously revolved around color and background styling, so there was a lot to learn. A few things that I learned that really stuck out were inputs and forms, iframes (especially learning how to embed maps), and typography.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

My work cycle for this assignment was kind of chaotic, since I've been in the midst of finals. I knew since I learned how to connect multiple pages that I wanted to do a Stark Industries site, and it's a project that I will probably continue with even after I'm finished with this class. It was pretty easy for me to come up with content for the index, about, and contact pages, but I had a hard time deciding on what to make the fourth page about. Eventually, I decided to make it a news page; however, I'd already created the page and some styling for it with the placeholder name of services, so I didn't change those.

The first thing I created was the page header the main logo, then the dropdown menu. I also created a search bar, just because I felt like it pulled the whole page header together. Once I was done, I added this page header to each of my pages. I struggled with the main page's image a bit because all I wanted of the main page was a big image of Stark Tower, with a color gradient over it and the Stark Industries slogan present. I struggled to find a good enough quality image of Stark Tower, then had some issues creating a gradient, but I eventually got it to look the way I wanted it to. Then I moved on to the About page.

I wrote an abridged history of Stark Industries myself, including some personal ides to the mix, such as Harley Keener being an upcoming CEO to Stark Industries. This page eventually gave me some issues when the content overflowed and the scroll bar wouldn't appear; I think these issues were due to using "position: absolute" and then directly placing my divs. I eventually worked it out, though I'm not totally sure how. I just went back and forth fiddling with the position of my divs, then added an overflow element. I also added a gallery at the bottom of the page, which I ended up having to split into two because the formatting became a little wonky; I would have liked all the images to be the same height, as well, but when I attempted that, they ended up overlapping and breaking the gallery. The About page is probably my least favorite, but I'm still proud of it.

From the About Page, I moved onto the Contact page. I had a very simple but aesthetically pleasing idea for this page, so it was pretty easy to create. I briefly forgot the form element and was confused as to why the inputs weren't working, but I eventually figured it out. I really like the background image I chose for this page as well.

Finally, I worked on the now-news page. I decided to create three thumbnail articles for various events happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and even looked up known reporters and dates of events within the timeline. I wanted the thumbnails to be faux-clickable, so I added a hover that changed some of the styling to show it. I also added a map of a fake address for Stark Tower in Manhattan, which is where it is located in the universe.
