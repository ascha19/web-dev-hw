        According to Wikipedia, which is obviously the most reliable site ever, the pattern in question was never cup-central, and is called the Jazz design, otherwise known as the Solo Jazz Pattern by the prestiged Know Your Meme. This pattern consists of a wide teal stroke in a crayon-scribble style with an thinner, overlapping magenta stroke in the same style; where these strokes overlap, their combined colors make a dark purple color.

        The design was created by the Sweetheart Cup Company and was later acquired by the Solo Cup Company. Very little was known about the origins of the design before the design rose to popularity in 2015 and a Reddit thread looked into it. Gina Ekiss, of Sweetheart's art department, is known to be the creator.

        "Amazing! Fantastic! This product radiated 90s vibes so hard that when I held a party, I made sure to put this on all my cups. All my friends had to go to the chiropractor after getting flung back in time so hard they got whiplash! Totally rad, duuuuuuuuude! Even better, anything you put in the cups with this pattern automatically tastes like a roller rink paper cup, even the chips!" - Bastard George
