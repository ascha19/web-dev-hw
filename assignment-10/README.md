1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

System fonts are fonts already installed on the device being used. Web fonts are fonts that are being hosted on a server and don't need to be installed on a device to be viewed, but must be called correctly in order to appear. Web-safe fonts are fonts that should be included by and thus able to be viewed with both Windows and Mac, meaning the device will already have them on it.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

Fallback fonts are important because, if the main font can't be accessed or takes a while to load properly, another font that should work can be loaded and viewed in its place. A font stack is a list of these fallback fonts, and the program will go through the list and try every font until one loads properly.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I originally started with an entirely different idea, but it was less typography-based, so I changed it. It may be a good idea to do for my final assignment, though.

Anyway, I started by looking up the media and information I would need. I decided to model my page around the Bee Movie, because the first scene(s) is what I decided to work with for this assignment, so I looked up some bee/honey-related images. I ended up needing to alter them, with permission from the original uploaders; I ended up with a honey-drip background and graphic of a bee on a piece of honeycomb. I initially wanted the bee to be a sticky element, but I couldn't figure out how to place it where I wanted it to be. I also grabbed my fonts, found a copy of the Bee Movie script, and looked up the IMDb for the movie for my info link.

First thing I did in my styles was create the background and div color schemes that I wanted, then I added my fonts and link. Then I began writing out the pieces of the script that I wanted to include, formatting as I went; most font styling was just to bring attention to bee puns via color changes, and also just to mess with alignment. It's supposed to look both organized and a little chaotic, kind of like how the movie is both a regular movie but also very weird.

Finally, I went back and added my pseudo elements, to my link and the introduction div. Then I double-checked to make sure everything worked and looked proper, and answered the required questions.
