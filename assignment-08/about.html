      <h1>Who</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Avery and I'm a Media Design student. This site and project, despite the overall personal fun I had with it, were created as an assignment for my Web Design class.
        </p>
      <h1>What</h1>
        <p>
          It's no surprise that this squishy is modeled after the one and only Marvel's Captain America shield. However, while I used the regular red, white, and blue fabrics, by all means take creative liberty and use some wild colors instead. This design is also a work-in-progress, and my test project is by no means perfect.
        </p>
      <h1>When</h1>
        <p>
          The squishy was designed and created in a span of a few hours, one or two days ago; so somewhere around June 3rd and 5th, 2020. The site itself is still actively being worked on created as I'm typing this, at about 15 minutes to 10 pm on a Sunday.
        </p>
      <h1>Where</h1>
        <p>
          Both the squishy and site were/are being created within my humble abode, primarily in my art workspace or the living room while watching weird movies and weirder reality TV.
        </p>
      <h1>Why</h1>
        <p>
          Superheroes, especially those of the Marvel universe, have been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I own a lot of Marvel merch, including Pop! figures, comics, and clothes. I've drawn some of the characters as well, so I decided to make something new to add to my collection. I've made other pillow/squishy-style pieces in the past, so this is nothing new.
