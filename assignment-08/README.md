1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

In the Creative Coding course I took during my first semester, we mainly focused on CSS. I must have worked with HTML at least a bit in that class, and/or in my free time, because a lot of what I've done so far in the class has felt familiar. That being said, I've experienced a lot of new stuff as well, such as divs, forms, and embedding. Learning how comment boxes, login forms, and buttons are made and used was really neat.

2. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

As I mentioned above and previously, I took a class that focused mainly on CSS during my first semester in college. Based on this assignment, especially regarding styling, it seems like I've retained a decent amount of knowledge; hopefully it'll come in handy. I do remember having some issues when I've worked with CSS in the past, so I'm hoping it'll be a smoother ride this time around. Overall, I'm just excited to add for design elements to my weekly web design, and I hope to get into more detail work.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I started out by creating the basic files and pages, and adding the main data. I worked on the index.html first, which was pretty easy to come up with; in order to get the pictures, I had to spend time actually making the product before I even started the site. I used creating the index to decide on what color scheme I wanted for the full site, and came up with lighter versions of the squishy's color scheme, the pink, white, and lighter blue to its red, white, and blue. I decorating each page with a different setup of the same colors, but ultimately decided against it.

After finishing the index page, I moved on to the contact page, which was also pretty easy to design. I couldn't figure out where else to put a table, so I decided to create one for "best times to contact the creator." The address I included was the address for the University, so I decided to embed a map for the University as well. Then I moved onto the about page, which was the only one I didn't have a specific idea for beforehand. I ended up coming up with answering the five W's: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. This was mainly for fun.

Finally, I went back and filled in the metadata because I kind of forgot to in the beginning. Then I double-checked to make sure the links were working and everything looked how I wanted it to. Then I completed the assignment by answering these README questions.
