Firstly, I added the folder for assignment-06, then the usual components of index, README, and image folder. After that, I did the basic setup and formatting within the index.html and README.md.

Once the basics were done, I moved on to actually adding content, starting with the contact info for the shop I chose for this assignment, which was The Crystal Limit. I added more information to the <head> portion of the index, then added content to the bones of the table I'd created first. After that, I did some adjusting to the table to make sure the days and hours looked the way I wanted them too, and then I added some style details to make the table to nicer overall, such as a colored border around said table.

After the shop information work, I went on to adding input elements and text areas. After adding the skeleton, I added two forms specified for login and another for a coupon sign-up. Then I added a text box for comments.
