1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs are block-level elements that are used to section off rows for media galleries, which will then fill a page edge-to-edge with other devs. Ids are used to give unique identifiers to each div, which is helpful when creating a link to a specific part of a page. Classes are also identifiers, used for grouping elements with the same name values. Finally, spans are the inline version of divs and they're used to identify and group content together that requires extra styling.

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text is text that accessibility functions, such as text readers, use to describe an image to a viewer who can not see it or has a hard time doing so. In this case, I used alt text to describe my album covers.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

Firstly, I started out the usual way of adding the skeleton of the page: the folders and files, the main sections of the index and the main metadata of the <head> portion of said index, and the sections for the README. I also downloaded the needed materials and researched the song I was going to make the page about; this included saving images of the album art, which, for this song, there was two versions of. After that, I followed along with the reading in order to add the required styles and divs; I also added the divs' classes. I had a couple formatting mishaps with the setup of the divs but they were easy to fix.

From then on, I went from easiest to hardest filling out the rest of the page information. First, I added the album cover art within the art section, sizing it to my liking and adding titles; in this case, there were two album covers to include. I added the song title, band name, and lyrics to the lyrics section, and added the copyright statement. Then I worked on adding the video, obtained from YouTube, to the video section, which I had some issues with. Try as I might, the video and audio continued to not work, at least on my end; I troubleshot as much as I could and came to the conclusion that it has something to do with my personal browser and issues with an X-Frame-Options policy, so hopefully it works on everyone else's ends. Anyway, once I was finished fiddling with both the video and audio sections, I finished up the copyright section and moved on to answering the README questions.
