    <p>This is my first webpage! Actually, it's only my first webpage in this class. I took Creative Coding 1 during my first semester of college, so I learned a lot of this stuff already, like how to make a repo and most of the content inside it, and how to use GitHub. This account is actually the one I used for that class, and the stuff I made during that class is still on it! </p>
