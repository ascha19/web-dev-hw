      <h1>Founding of Stark Industries</h1>
      <p>Stark Industries was founded by Howard Stark in 1940. Previously, it was mainly a defense company that developed and manufactured advanced weapons and military technologies. In World War II, Stark Industries quickly established itself as a military contractor by building 100,000 planes in order to help the Allied Forces. In the same year Stark Industries was founded, Howard—and thus Stark Industries resources—joined the Strategic Scientific Reserve, or S.S.R. It is also known that Howard Stark not only created the infamous shield of Captain America but created the super soldier serum that was used on him.</p>

      <h1>A Change in Business</h1>
      <p>After Howard Stark’s death in 1991, ownership of Stark Industries was passed down to Howard’s son, Tony Stark, though the company was mainly run by Obadiah Stane. Under Tony Stark, Stark Industries became the world leader of development and manufacturing of advanced weapons; the company also branched out into more scientific fields, such as aeronautics and robotics. However, in 2008, after a near-fatal run-in with a terrorist group and learning that Obadiah Stane himself was the one providing the group with Stark Industries-labeled weapons, Tony shut down all weapon manufacturing within the company and took over running the company himself. The company turned fully to the scientific and technological research and advancements, including micro-technology and fringe science. The company has made such advancements as the new, clean energy provider, the arc reactor, fueled by the element Starkonium, which was discovered by Tony himself. Stark Industries is also known for its development of the Helicarriers used by the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division, or S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
      <p>In 2010, while he continued to carry ownership to Stark Industries, Tony Stark relinquished the title of CEO to his assistant at the time, and now wife, Virginia “Pepper” Potts. She stepped down from the title for a short time, but ultimately remained CEO from 2012 onward. Stark Industries has continued its focus on clean energy and advancements in technology and science, as well as offered its materials to the Avengers Initiative around this time.</p>

      <h1>Recent Past and Future</h1>
      <p>In 2018, it was believed that Tony Stark may have perished, like many others, due to The Snap caused by Thanos. However, he returned to Earth from being trapped in space in 2023. After recovering from five years of space survival, and then the loss of his arm after his second and final encounter with Thanos as the infamous Iron Man, Tony continues to run Stark Industries from the background, alongside CEO and wife Pepper Potts, and Stark Industries’ youngest heir to date—despite her not quite being involved in the company yet—five-year-old Morgan Stark. While Morgan is heir to ownership of Stark Industries, the person most likely next in line to run the company as CEO is Tony’s protégé, the 22-year-old Harley Keener; Tony’s other protégé, 18-year-old Peter Parker, who would be around the same age as Keener had he not disappeared in The Snap, is another consideration for future Stark Industries CEO, but has quite a lot to learn first.</p>
