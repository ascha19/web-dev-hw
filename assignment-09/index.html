        According to Wikipedia, which is obviously the most reliable site ever, the pattern in question was never cup-central, and is called the Jazz design, otherwise known as the Solo Jazz Pattern by the prestiged Know Your Meme. This pattern consists of a wide teal stroke in a crayon-scribble style with an thinner, overlapping magenta stroke in the same style; where these strokes overlap, their combined colors make a dark purple color.
