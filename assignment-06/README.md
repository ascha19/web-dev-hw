1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

A couple examples of forms I've used while using the web are text inputs, which allows text to be written and submitted to a page, and button inputs, which allow actions such as submissions to go through. These forms are common for logins to just about any site, and just about any place where you can leave a comment.

2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

An example of a text input would be a text area, which is essentially what a comment box is and thus is used to write comments on most sites, such as the comment sections on the beneath YouTube videos. One type of selection input is a radio button, which are used to make to use something similar to multiple choice selections; these are often used during online applications for schools and work and online surveys. Finally, an example of a button input is the upload button, which is used just about anywhere you can upload something, whether that be a video onto YouTube or a homework assignment for Moodle.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Firstly, I added the folder for assignment-06, then the usual components of index, README, and image folder. After that, I did the basic setup and formatting within the index.html and README.md.

Once the basics were done, I moved on to actually adding content, starting with the contact info for the shop I chose for this assignment, which was The Crystal Limit. I added more information to the <head> portion of the index, then added content to the bones of the table I'd created first. After that, I did some adjusting to the table to make sure the days and hours looked the way I wanted them too, and then I added some style details to make the table to nicer overall, such as a colored border around said table.

After the shop information work, I went on to adding input elements and text areas. After adding the skeleton, I added two forms specified for new member sign-ups and another for a coupon sign-up. Then I added a text box for comments, along with a "review" form for the site. Finally, I added submit buttons to both the member and coupon sign-ups, and the review section. I made some minor cosmetic edits, then moved on to answering the questions featured here.
