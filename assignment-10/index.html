      <p>According to all known laws of aviation,<br/>
        there is no way a bee should be able to fly.</p>
      <p>Its wings are too small<br/>
        to get its fat little body off the ground.</p>
      <p>The bee, of course, flies anyway<br/>
        because bees don't care what humans think is impossible...</p>

      <p>Barry, breakfast is ready!</p>

      <p>Oh, hang on a second. Hello?</p>

        Can you believe this is happening?</p>
      <p class="blackleft">Can't believe it. I'll pick you up.</p>

      <p>Looking sharp.</p>
      <p>Barry, why don't you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those!</p>
      <p>Sorry, I'm excited.</p>
      <p>Here's the graduate! We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card. All
        <span style="color: black">B's</span>.

      <p>Very proud.</p>
      <p>Ma! I got a thing going here.</p>
      <p>You got some lint on your fuzz.</p>
      <p>Ow! That's me!</p>

      <p>Hey, Adam.</p>
      <p>Hey, Barry.</p>
      <p>Is that fuzz gel?</p>
      <p>A little. It's a special day, finally graduating!</p>
      <p>Never thought I'd make it.</p>
      <p>Three days of grade school. Three days of high school.</p>
      <p>Those were so awkward.</p>
      <p>Three days of college. I'm glad I took a day of in the middle and hitchhiked around the <span style="color: black">hive</span>.</p>
      <p>You did come back different.</p>
      <p>Hi, Barry!</p>
      <p>Hey, Artie. Growing a mustache? Looks good!</p>
      <p>Hey, did you hear about Frankie?</p>
      <p>Yeah.</p>
      <p>You going to his funeral?</p>
      <p>No, I'm not going to his funeral! Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.</p>
      <p>Yeah, I guess he just could've gotten out of the way.</p>
      <p class="blackleft">Whoa!</p>
      <p class="blackright">Woohoo!</p>
      <p>I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day.</p>
      <p>I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.</p>
      <p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp, under the cicumstances. Well Adam, today we are men.</p>
      <p>We are.</p>
      <p><span style="color:black">Bee</span> men.</p>
      <p>A-men.</p>
      <p class="blackcenter">Hallelujah!</p>
