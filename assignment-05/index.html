  <h2>Lemon Madeleines</h2>

<hr />

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup (180 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) salt</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar</li>
    <li>Grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) unsalted butter, <u>melted <strong>and cooled</strong> to room temparature</u></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and lemon zest with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes or until the mixture forms a ribbon when the beater is lifted.</li>
    <li>With a whisk, gently fold in the dry ingredients. Fold the butter in the same way. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 200 °C (400 °F). Butter and flour a small madeleine pan. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Fill each cavity three-quarter up with batter. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the madelienes are lightly golden brown. Remove from the pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining of the batter. <em>If desired, serve with lemon curd.</em></li>
  </ol>

      <em><strong>Note:</strong> This batter will keep for three to four days in the refrigerator. Madeleines are best baked the same day they will be eaten. The baking time for standard-sized madeleines is about 14 minutes.</em>
