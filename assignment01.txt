1. How is the web different than the internet?
The internet is a global network, made up of other independent networks. The Web (World Wide Web or www) is accessed via the internet and is a collection of data that can be viewed and shared.

2. Briefly describe how the internet works.
The internet is a wire buried in the ground. Things connected to this wire, such as servers, can interact with each other and share information, such as web pages; everyday computers are  indirectly connected to the internet via service providers, making them clients. Information is shared via the internet by being broken down into pieces called packets and then reassembled when they reach their destination. IP addresses and routers prevent information from accidentally going to other destinations. 

3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
A directory is a system of files and how they're nested. Directories, or folders, are used to hold and organize files of like information. 

4. Why is using a VCS beneficial?
A version control system, or VCS, is useful because it allows you to save a snapshot of your project anytime you want; it's kind of a timeline of every moment of your project's development. It also helps to easily revert back to previous version of your project and makes sharing and collaboration easier.
